\section{Budget}
For the following reasons, this project has no anticipated costs.  Firstly, Dr Rhinelander and Reiland Systems have absorbed the cost of the quadcopter.  Secondly, the control hardware (Raspberry Pi and Arduino) are provided by the group for the duration of the project.  At the end of the project ownership of the control hardware will be retained by their respective owners, as well as ownership of the quadcopter being retained by Dr Rhinelander.  Lastly, all of our deliverables are provided either as open software or within software platforms that our client already has access too (e.g. SimuLink).

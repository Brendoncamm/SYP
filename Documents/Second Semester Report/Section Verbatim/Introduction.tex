\subsection{Physical Implementation}


The physical implementation of the drone software and hardware requires a communication channel between a control input, a base station host, a wireless communication receiving unit, and a host for the controlling system. The objective of the physical implementation is to provide the software and hardware design required to successfully implement a quadrotor drone flight controller. It is desired to have a controller that is capable of sensing disturbances in flight and stabilizing the system based upon the measured disturbances.

The objectives of the physical implementation for the project begin with successfully creating a WiFi communication channel between a controller input and a wireless device placed on the drone hardware. The drone is to have flight sensing capabilities, interfaced with both the on board wireless device and a grounded controlling station. The flight sensing is to include yaw, pitch, roll and altitude measurements with a polling rate sufficient for real time control of the drone. The flight sensing is to be combined with a set point from the wirelessly transmitted control input by a PI or PID loop to control the flight of the drone with stabilizing features. The code written for the control input, communication interface, and finally the controller is to be well documented to ensure ease of use and simplicity for updating and modifying after handing over the final product.


\subsection{Graphical User Interface}


The Graphical User Interface (GUI) requires a network connection between the base station host it lives on and the Raspberry Pi 3 to recieve the serialized dictionaries containing sensor data and controller information. The objective of the GUI is to provide the user with a medium to access information regarding the current flight, such as, the altitude at which the drone has flown or how the physical controller is configured. It is desired to have a real time plot of the altitude based on the sensor information and the ability to initialize the physical controller. 

The objectives for the GUI for the project start with selecting an appropriate development framework that will function across Windows, Mac OS and Unix environments.  The GUI is to have the ability to initialize the communications between the base station host and Raspberry Pi 3 to allow for the control inputs to be sent using the base station host as well as receiving the data that is to be displayed on the GUI. The GUI is to be intuitive to avoid any unneccessary confusion with the end user. The code written and any other software used for the GUI will be provided and well documented to ensure that in event that the end user would like to modify anything after receiving the final product, this can be done effortlessly.

		The following report summarizes the progress made throughout the Quad Rotor Drone Programmable Flight Controller project and the future recommendations based upon project findings. The goal of the project is to design a programmable quadcopter flight controller that will have the capability of responding to live control inputs and react appropriately to disturbances present. The objective of this report is to summarize the deliverables set forth for the project and to present findings, results and testing procedures. The report also outlines the design process of the project. The Quad Rotor Flight Controller project has three major components; flight and stabilizing simulations, implementation of software, and a GUI interface.

	\section{Conclusion}
	Although there are plenty of existing quad-rotor drone controllers, some of which that can even handle a varied amount of rotors.  The process of developing our own, without "looking under the hood" of existing controllers has been both exciting and difficult.  To this date, we have built the ground work of for a flight controller capable of controlling the pitch, roll, yaw, and altitude of a quad-rotor drone.  While, only altitude control remains tested to this date.  As the term is not yet finished; We continue to hope to finish the control of the remaining controllers, as well as putting them under a proof of concept test.  As well as polishing the interfaces to handle sensor data feedback and controller parameter updates.  
	
	We would like to think Dr. Jason Rhinelander, for the the opportunity and support through the past 8 months.  As well as Preston Stronarch for his suggestions and aid during testing.

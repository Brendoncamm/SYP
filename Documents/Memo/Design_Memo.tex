\section{Background}
%Dr Rhinelander, Reiland Systems.  Open controller platform. End goal for Dr R to use for machine learning.
We have been tasked to design a programmable flight controller for a quad-rotor drone by Dr. Jason Rhinelander of Reiland Systems Limited. Most commercial off the shelf drones currently available do not have the ability to customize the firmware on the device which limits the ability to carry out any type of research. Dr. Rhinelanderâ€™s research is highly focused on machine learning algorithms and to further his research he requires a quad-rotor drone with the ability to program or tweak different algorithms on the fly. 
\section{Objectives}
%End goals, leave intermediate objectives to deliverables/timing.
\subsection{Short Term Objectives (October 2016-December 2016)}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Simulations of the controller and flight dynamics 
	\item Construction of the quad-rotor drone
	\item Initial design of the controller (physical and software)
	\item Initial testing
	\item First term report
\end{itemize}
\subsection{Long Term Objectives (January 2017 - April 2017)}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Final design of controller (physical and software)
	\item Graphical User Interface design
	\item Final testing 
	\item Final report
\end{itemize}
\section{Specifications}
\subsection{Design Criteria}
%Desired specifications.
\begin{itemize}
	\item Able to respond to control inputs appropriately and instantaneously 
	\item Able to hover steadily 
	\item Able to fly for 15-20 minutes continuously
\end{itemize}
\subsection{Constraints}
%Limitations to the design process.
\section{Deliverables}

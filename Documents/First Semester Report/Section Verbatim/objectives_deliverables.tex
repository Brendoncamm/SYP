\section{Objectives and Deliverables}
\subsection{Short Term Objectives (October 2016 - December 2016)}
1) Simulation

	The simulations will allow us to gain an understanding of how the controller will respond to specific inputs. The simulation can then be tuned until the output is within the constraints set by Dr. Rhinelander. We will be simulating both the flight dynamics and controller using MATLAB and Simulink exclusively.

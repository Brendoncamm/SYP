\section{Background and Significance}
Quadrotor drones have been on the rise in popularity in the last several years due to their simplistic mechanical design and many practical uses. The application of these drones vary from a hobbyist flying around their neighbourhood to military personnel carrying out high risk missions. A video recording device of some sort is generally attached to the drone and the video feed is relayed to a basesation for the operator to gain a field of view (FOV) of an area of interest. Having the capability to have a continuous video feed allows the drone to be used for many practical applications such as: traffic monitoring, surveillance missions and many more.
